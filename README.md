# Hey! ðŸ¥¤

My name's Jeffry Wainwright. I go by Jeff. 
I'm passionate about coding, [art](https://www.instagram.com/porkypaints/), [surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlE4oSnF05/), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335), and fitness in general.

I love trying to make complex things simple. 
I enjoy mentoring and the constant challenge it provides me. 

### Open Source

I've written a fair amount of open source and hope to do more.

Lately, I've been working hard at [@cuypay](https://github.com/curpay/) making our frontend apps easier to ship so my open source work is minimal.

I do watch issues, and review pull requests within the day. I will submit important updates quickly as needed. I will/do approach bigger issues within a few months (right now). 

### About @yowainwright

> My Github handle, ** "yowainwright"**, comes from talks with my dad in his woodshop. I'd sit on a workbench and tell him about my dreams, which were _always_ lofty. He would respond at key moments by pumping his fist and saying in a deep tone, "yoooo Wainwright! ". Not being a typical quick-learner, remembering his encouragement motivates in pursuit of achieving my goals
