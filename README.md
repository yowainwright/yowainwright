# Hey! ðŸ¥¤

My name's Jeffry Wainwright. I go by Jeff. I'm passionate about coding, [art](https://www.instagram.com/porkypaints/), [surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlE4oSnF05/), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335), and fitness in general. I love trying to make complex things simple. 
I enjoy mentoring and the constant challenge it provides me. 

## Open Source

I write a fair amount of open source. Much of my initial open source work has been forked from [Dollar Shave Club (DSC)](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub) where I  worked previously. My _now_ forked projects: [shave](https://github.com/yowainwright/shave), [stickybits](https://github.com/yowainwright/stickybits), [scrolldir](https://github.com/yowainwright/scrolldir/), [reframe.js](https://github.com/yowainwright/reframe.js), and [es-check](https://github.com/yowainwright/es-check). I watch issues for these PRs, and review pull requests within a day, generally. I submit important updates quickly as needed. I approach bigger issues for these repositories within a few months (right now). 

I'm currrently building tools for better community development. I'm deeply concerned with improving communication about everyday coding so I'm building [Heartly](https://github.com/heartly/heartly), [Common Utilities](https://github.com/yowainwright/common-utilities), and [Monorepo Utilities](https://github.com/yowainwright/monorepo-utilities). I work on a few other projects but making the projects listed above usable as a system is my open source goal for 2021.

## Talks, mentorship

I love to talk about code and mentor engineers I work closely with. I've [done one talk at JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE). Keeping things simple on all levels is important to me.
