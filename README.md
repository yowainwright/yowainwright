### Hey there 👋

**“yowainwright”** is derived from conversations talking with my dad in his wood shop. I'd sit on workbench and tell him about my dreams which were _always_ lofty. He would respond at key moments by pumping is fist in a winning gesture and say in a deep tone, “yoooo Wainwright!“. Not being a typical quick-learner, his encouragement motivates me to continue to persue my dreams.

I'm passionate about coding, art, surfing, running, and fitness in general. I love trying to make complex things simple—or trying to. I enjoy mentoring and the constant challenge it provides me. I've written a fair amount of open source and hope to do more. Lately I've been working hard at @cuypay making our frontend apps easily to ship.
