# Hey! ðŸ¥¤

My name's Jeffry Wainwright. I go by Jeff. 
I'm passionate about coding, [art](https://www.instagram.com/porkypaints/), [surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlE4oSnF05/), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335), and fitness in general. 

I love trying to make complex things simple. 
I enjoy mentoring and the constant challenge it provides me. 

## Open Source

I've written a fair amount of open source and hope to do more.

I do watch issues, and review pull requests within the day. I will submit important updates quickly as needed. I will/do approach bigger issues within a few months (right now). 

## Talks, mentorship

I love to talk about code and mentor engineers I work closely with. I've [done one talk at JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE). Keeping things simple on all levels is important to me.
