## Open Source

I've written a fair amount of open source! I wrote my most used software, including [shave](https://github.com/yowainwright/shave), [stickybits](https://github.com/yowainwright/stickybits), [scrolldir](https://github.com/yowainwright/scrolldir/), [reframe.js](https://github.com/yowainwright/reframe.js), and [es-check](https://github.com/yowainwright/es-check)  while working at [Dollar Shave Club (DSC)](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub). 

I'm currently focus on building utilities to assist in everyday development and security. 

## As an engineer

Whether I'm learning, teaching, or getting stumped by a problem simple or hard, I love it all! 
I've [done one talk at JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE). 
Happy to connect with other engineers who are interested in our craft!
