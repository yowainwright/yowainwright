#### Hey! 👋

I'm a husband, dad, & [software engineer](https://jeffry.in).<br>
When I'm not writing code, I enjoy fitness activities.<br>
[Surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlE4oSnF05/) and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335) are my current favorites.

I write articles on my blog, [Jeffry.in](https://jeffry.in), & have written articles for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/?s=yowainwright) as well.<br> 
I've presented at [JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE) on the benefits of CI/CD tools.

I currently architect developer experience tools for [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/).<br>
I do this using Typescript, Go, & Python.<br>
I'm excited about Rust!
