#### Hey!

I enjoy building with code and architecture - probably a little too much. I guess it's okay, considering I do it for work!<br>
When I'm not writing software, I enjoy creating, generally, and [fitness](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335).<br>

I write articles on my blog, [Jeffry.in](https://jeffry.in), & have written articles for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/?s=yowainwright).<br> 
I've presented at [JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE) on the benefits of CI/CD tools. I've worked and work on a few OSS teams; helping where I can. 

Most my open source is in JavaScript but I greatly enjoy Go and Python—really any modality.
