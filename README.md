### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Jeffry Wainwright, but I go by Jeff. 
I'm passionate about coding, art, surfing, running, and fitness in general. 
I love trying to make complex things simple. 
I enjoy mentoring and the constant challenge it provides me. 

### Open Source

I've written a fair amount of open source and hope to do more.
Lately, I've been working hard at @cuypay making our frontend apps easier to ship.

### About @yowainwright

> My Github handle, ** "yowainwright"**, comes from talks with my dad in his woodshop. I'd sit on a workbench and tell him about my dreams, which were _always_ lofty. He would respond at key moments by pumping his fist and saying in a deep tone, "yoooo Wainwright! ". Not being a typical quick-learner, remembering his encouragement motivates in pursuit of achieving my goals
