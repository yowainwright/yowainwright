# Hey! ðŸ¥¤

My name's Jeffry Wainwright. I go by Jeff. I'm passionate about coding, [art](https://www.instagram.com/porkypaints/), [surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlE4oSnF05/), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/722335), and fitness in general. I love making complex things simple.

## Open Source

I enjoy writing and using open source! I wrote much of my open source work including [shave](https://github.com/yowainwright/shave), [stickybits](https://github.com/yowainwright/stickybits), [scrolldir](https://github.com/yowainwright/scrolldir/), [reframe.js](https://github.com/yowainwright/reframe.js), and [es-check](https://github.com/yowainwright/es-check)  while working at [Dollar Shave Club (DSC)](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub). 

I'm currently focused on building secure simple utilities to assist in everyday development. [React-Utilities](https://github.com/react-utilities/react-utilities), [Heartly](https://github.com/heartly/heartly), [Common Utilities](https://github.com/yowainwright/common-utilities), and [Monorepo Utilities](https://github.com/yowainwright/monorepo-utilities). Making the projects listed above usable as systems for every day development is my open source goal for 2021.

## Talks, mentorship

I love to talk about code! I enjoy learning and/or mentoring engineers I work closely with. I've [done one talk at JS.LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YQ8BGSOsyE). Keeping things simple on all levels is important to me.
