### Hey there 👋

**“yowainwright”** is derived from conversations talking with my dad in his wood shop. I'd sit on workbench and tell him about my dreams which were _always_ lofty. He would respond at key moments by pumping is fist in a winning gesture and say in a deep tone, “yoooo Wainwright!“. Not being a typical quick-learner, his encouragement motivates me to continue to persue my dreams. The end.
